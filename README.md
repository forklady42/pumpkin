A seam carver implementation for [content aware image scaling] (http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/SCWeb/imret/imret.pdf).

[Read my reflections on this project.] (http://betsy-cannon.com/2012/11/07/seam-carving.html)

##Usage

    $ python carve.py

will ask for the file path to the original image and the desired aspect ratio entered as width:height. 
Alternatively, `import carve` and directly call `carve(file, ratio)`. (Note: in the second case, ratio should be a float.)

##Example

Height and width reductions using this implementation:

##Limitations
Currently, this implementation changes aspect ratio only by removing pixels, thereby, 
reducing the size of the image. In the future, support will be added for expanding the  
image as well.

In general, seam carving does not handle content dense images well, as there are no low energy seams to remove.
